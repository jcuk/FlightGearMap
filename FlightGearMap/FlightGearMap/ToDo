Bugs:
    - If you are in portrait mode and if you turn instruments off, click done, then turn them back on, the instruments will be rotated to landscape mode if it isn't clearly in portrait mode (e.g. this happens when the orientation is questionable, could be be portrait or landscape depending on what it was last). When in this bug mode, the only thing that is different is that the instruments are in a 2x3 layout and the background is wider, but still extends to the ground.
